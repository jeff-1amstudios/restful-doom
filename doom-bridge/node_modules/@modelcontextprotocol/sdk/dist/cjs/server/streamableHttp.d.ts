 * // Stateful mode - server sets the session ID
 * const statefulTransport = new StreamableHTTPServerTransport({
 *   sessionIdGenerator: () => randomUUID(),
 * });
 *
 * // Stateless mode - explicitly set session ID to undefined
 * const statelessTransport = new StreamableHTTPServerTransport({

 * });
 *
 * // Using with pre-parsed request body
 * app.post('/mcp', (req, res) => {
 *   transport.handleRequest(req, res, req.body);
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * In stateful mode:
 * - Session ID is generated and included in response headers
 * - Session ID is always included in initialization responses
 * - Requests with invalid session IDs are rejected with 404 Not Found
 * - Non-initialization requests without a session ID are rejected with 400 Bad Request
 * - State is maintained in-memory (connections, message history)
 *
 * In stateless mode:
 * - No Session ID is included in any responses
 * - No session validation is performed
